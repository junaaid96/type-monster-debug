                <h1>Differences between localStorage and sessionStorage</h1>
                <p>TlocalStorage is used for long term use and sessionStorage is used when you need to store somthing
                    that changes or somthing temporary. localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data
                    is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded
                    in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time.</p>

                <h1>Differences between Global Scope and Block Scope</h1>
                <p>The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and
                    have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that
                    program, any function or conditional state can access that variable. Block scope is also a sub-type
                    of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly
                    brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something
                    else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.</p>

                <h1>What is Event Loop in JavaScript?</h1>
                <p>The event loop is a constantly running process that monitors both the callback queue and the call
                    stack. If the call stack is not empty, the event loop waits until it is empty and places the next
                    function from the callback queue to the call stack. JavaScript suppports asynchornus programming
                    through the event loop.</p>
